**User story**

As I am a pet lover I want an application which serves all the needs from getting a [Project Idea.pdf](https://github.com/Sakshi-2672/leap-project/files/6564651/Project.Idea.pdf)

pet adopted and fulfil their basic need from their food to their shelter which I can 
order online and get them by my doorstep. Also contact of veterinarian for the 
consultation of my pet to take proper care of them. Among the hectic daily 
schedule it becomes difficult to take proper care of them and give them best food 
and environment to grow, so some application which takes care of all these 
necessities of mine would make life of many pet lovers like me a lot easier.


**SCQ**

1) Situation
In emergency for petâ€™s health issue this application would show the veterinarian 
and the shortest path to reach them quickly
2) Challenge
Difficult to use by rural area people due to lack of awareness, sources providing 
pets for adaptation in real time
3) Question
* Best way to get all the data of pets available for adaptation in real time?
* How it would be beneficial to rural people and how to use the application?

The project idea is to build a mobile application which serves all the need of pet 
lovers, who wants to adopt a pet with all the necessary care needed for their pets.
Facilities to be added:
* User can choose a pet to adopt
* User can buy all the goods that their pet needs like food, shelter/cage, 
accessories, etc.
* User can be in contact of veterinarian online
* User can visit veterinarian by following the shortest path.
